# Adaptive Variational Memory Encoding for Recurrent Data Synthesis

This is the code for my paper: *Adaptive Variational Memory Encoding for Recurrent Data Synthesis*. The pdf is available [here](https://samgriesemer.com/research/avme.pdf) if you'd like to take a look.

Unfortunately, some parts of the original implementation appear to be broken in recent Pytorch updates and I haven't found time to fix them. However, the sampling script remains intact and works with the available pre-trained models. I'll briefly describe how one might set that up:

1. Make sure you have [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/), Jupyter, Numpy, and Matplotlib installed wherever you plan to run the sampling script
2. Clone the repo and start up a Jupyter notebook server
3. Navigate to the `sample.ipynb` Jupyter notebook
4. Execute the single cell in the notebook and outputs should be displayed

If you have any questions regarding the paper or code feel free to let me know.
